# SynthMart
Student project for a Software Engineering course, a full web-app using React, Next.js, and MySQL.

# Description
SynthMart is an online marketplace specifically for buying and selling synthesizer hardware. Users can create an account and login with their credentials; the account allows them to add/edit listings, or buy from other users. All listings are shown on the homepage, and these can be filtered through with standard sorting/searching. Products can be added to the userâ€™s cart with a click of a button; the shopping cart calculates the total price, including any discounts and taxes. Once purchased, users can view the order on their profile page. System admin accounts are also available to manually edit any listing and discount codes on the website.
